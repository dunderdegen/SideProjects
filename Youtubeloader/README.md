### Youtube Loader Gui

#### Hi! 

Thanks for checking in! 

This is my first finished python project, so take it easy on it. 

Needed assets: 

        pip install pytube
        pip install PILLOW
        pip install customtkinter

Paste a link to a Youtube-video in the text-field and press download. It should then download the video in the best found format to your downloads folder.
